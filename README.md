## ## About This Project

This project contains the solutions to 25 common and tricky pattern-based coding questions. The main goal is to strengthen foundational programming skills. Each problem is solved and stored in its own file for clarity.

**Key Goals:**
* **Practice:** Sharpen skills in using nested loops.
* **Logic Building:** Enhance logical thinking and problem decomposition.
* **Revision:** A quick and effective way to review these classic problems.
* **Community:** Share solutions and approaches with fellow learners.

## ## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3.  **Explore the solutions:** Each file is named according to the pattern number (e.g., `Pattern01.js`, `Pattern02.py`).
4.  **Try it yourself!** Before looking at a solution, try to code the pattern on your own. It's the best way to learn!
